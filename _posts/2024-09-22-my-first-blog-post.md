some people say a man is made out of mud \
a poor man's made out of muscle and blood \
muscle and blood and skin and bone \
a mind that's weak and a back that's strong

you load sixteen tons, what do you get \
another day older, a day deeper in debt \
saint peter don't you call me cause i can't go \
i owe my soul to the company store
